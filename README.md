# Ikea Stock Watcher

Prior to the pandemic of 2020 my wife and I began planning a kitchen remodel using Ikea cabinets. After a lot of planning we were ready to purchase our cabinets. Unfortunately Ikea cabinets had become very difficult to get ahold of. I wrote this Ikea Stock Watcher in order to track the current and upcoming availability for the specific cabinets that we needed for our project.
